# Bamana Task Map

This file tracks explicit development tasks for outstanding Milestone 1 work.
Milestone 1 is the Native BGZF Core milestone described in
`docs/roadmap/milestone-01-bgzf.md` and
`docs/roadmap/current_milestone.md`.

## Milestone 1 Definition

Milestone 1 is complete only when Bamana owns BGZF reading, BGZF writing, EOF
marker handling, and the minimal virtual-offset groundwork needed by later BAM
index and random-access work. The milestone is substrate work first; higher
level command behavior must not hide gaps in BGZF ownership.

## Current Completion State

Status: incomplete.

Known present pieces:

* native BGZF EOF marker detection exists and is used by `check_eof`;
* shallow BAM verification can inspect a BAM-like BGZF container and first-block
  BAM magic;
* BAM-compatible BGZF writing exists for current first-slice BAM outputs;
* unit tests cover several BGZF and BAM writer behaviors;
* `noodles` usage is isolated to the CRAM compatibility module in production
  code.

Known blockers before Milestone 1 can be closed:

* the full test suite is not green in the current working tree;
* benchmark hooks for BGZF read throughput, write throughput, and EOF-check
  latency are not yet defined and runnable;
* virtual-offset groundwork is not yet represented as a dedicated public
  internal type;
* BGZF reader/writer ownership is still concentrated in broad modules rather
  than split into explicit `reader`, `writer`, `block`, and `virtual_offset`
  modules;
* public contract coverage is incomplete for public commands that already exist
  in the CLI, including `benchmark`, `fastq`, and `unmap`.

## Task List

### M1.1 Restore Green Verification

Status: complete.

Tasks:

* fix `commands::check_sort::tests::detects_unsorted_coordinate_violation`;
* fix `sampling::hash::tests::fnv1a64_is_stable` by either correcting the
  expected vector or correcting the implementation, with an explicit rationale;
* fix contract-test failures for forensic examples and fixture provenance
  metadata;
* run `cargo test`;
* run `cargo test --test contract`;
* record the final verification commands in the closing commit or PR notes.

Acceptance criteria:

* `cargo test` passes locally;
* `cargo test --test contract` passes locally;
* no failing test is ignored or weakened without a documented reason.

Completion evidence:

* `cargo test` passed with 100 library tests, 11 contract tests, and doc tests;
* `cargo test --test contract` passed with 11 contract tests;
* no test was ignored or weakened.

### M1.2 Make Public Contract Coverage Complete

Status: complete.

Tasks:

* add JSON schemas for `benchmark`, `fastq`, `unmap`, and `annotate_rg`;
* add success and failure examples for `benchmark`, `fastq`, `unmap`, and
  `annotate_rg`;
* update `spec/cli/commands.md` with complete command contracts for
  `benchmark`, `fastq`, and `unmap`;
* update `README.md` and `docs/cli.md` so the documented public CLI matches
  the actual CLI;
* update Sphinx documentation under `docs/sphinx/` for public command behavior
  that users need to operate;
* ensure contract tests enforce the public status of `benchmark`, `fastq`, and
  `unmap`.

Acceptance criteria:

* every public command exposed by `bamana --help` has a schema;
* every public command has at least one success and one failure example;
* contract tests fail if `benchmark`, `fastq`, or `unmap` documentation is
  removed or treated as experimental;
* user-facing and Sphinx docs describe the public commands without implying
  unsupported guarantees.

Completion evidence:

* added schemas and canonical examples for `benchmark`, `fastq`, `unmap`, and
  `annotate_rg`;
* added a contract test that protects `benchmark`, `fastq`, and `unmap` as
  public contract commands;
* updated `README.md`, `docs/cli.md`, `spec/cli/commands.md`, and Sphinx docs;
* `cargo test --test contract` passed with 12 contract tests;
* `cargo test` passed with 100 library tests, 12 contract tests, and doc tests;
* `python -m sphinx -b html docs/sphinx docs/sphinx/_build/html` passed.

### M1.3 Split BGZF Core Into Explicit Native Modules

Status: complete.

Tasks:

* introduce or complete `src/bgzf/reader.rs`;
* introduce or complete `src/bgzf/writer.rs`;
* introduce or complete `src/bgzf/block.rs`;
* introduce or complete `src/bgzf/virtual_offset.rs`;
* keep `src/bgzf/mod.rs` as the narrow public module facade;
* move shared constants, block metadata, EOF marker handling, and error
  boundaries into the appropriate native BGZF modules;
* update BAM reader and writer consumers to use the clarified BGZF API.

Acceptance criteria:

* BGZF block parsing and block writing are owned by `src/bgzf/*`;
* BAM modules do not duplicate BGZF container logic unnecessarily;
* module names match the roadmap ownership model;
* no production BGZF hot path is implemented through `noodles`.

Completion evidence:

* split the native BGZF substrate into `block`, `reader`, `writer`, and
  `virtual_offset` modules;
* moved `BgzfWriter` ownership from `bam::write` to `bgzf::writer` while
  preserving the existing `bam::write::BgzfWriter` import path as a
  compatibility re-export;
* kept `src/bgzf/mod.rs` as the public facade for EOF, signature, shallow
  first-member, and writer helpers;
* updated the Milestone 1 roadmap module-boundary documentation;
* `cargo test` passed with 100 library tests, 12 contract tests, and doc tests.

### M1.4 Define Virtual Offset Groundwork

Status: open.

Tasks:

* add a `VirtualOffset` type with compressed-block offset and uncompressed
  in-block offset components;
* validate component bounds according to BGZF virtual-offset semantics;
* provide conversion to and from the packed `u64` representation;
* add ordering tests;
* document which later BAI/CSI and random-access work will consume it.

Acceptance criteria:

* virtual offsets are not passed around as ambiguous raw integers in new BGZF
  code;
* invalid in-block offsets are rejected;
* tests cover packing, unpacking, ordering, and boundary values.

### M1.5 Strengthen BGZF Reader Tests

Status: open.

Tasks:

* add tests for valid single-block BGZF streams;
* add tests for multi-block streams;
* add tests for truncated block headers;
* add tests for truncated compressed payloads;
* add tests for invalid CRC or size metadata if the reader validates them;
* add tests proving BAM magic can be read from the first inflated BGZF member;
* add tests proving EOF marker presence is detected independently from deeper
  BAM validity.

Acceptance criteria:

* reader tests distinguish container validity, EOF marker presence, first-block
  BAM magic, and full payload validity;
* error responses preserve enough detail for JSON command failures;
* tests are native and do not depend on `noodles` for the production path.

### M1.6 Strengthen BGZF Writer Tests

Status: open.

Tasks:

* add tests for writing an empty BAM-compatible BGZF stream with EOF marker;
* add tests for writing payloads that require multiple BGZF blocks;
* add tests for round-tripping writer output through the native reader;
* add tests for deterministic EOF marker emission;
* add tests for large payload boundaries near the maximum BGZF block payload
  size.

Acceptance criteria:

* native writer output is accepted by the native reader;
* EOF marker behavior is deterministic;
* BAM writer consumers do not need to know BGZF block-layout details.

### M1.7 Add BGZF Microbenchmarks

Status: open.

Tasks:

* define a BGZF read-throughput microbenchmark;
* define a BGZF write-throughput microbenchmark;
* define an EOF-check latency microbenchmark;
* provide small, medium, and large input profiles or clear instructions for
  supplying them;
* document how to run the benchmarks locally;
* ensure benchmark outputs are machine-readable enough to compare future runs.

Acceptance criteria:

* benchmark commands are documented;
* benchmark hooks can run without requiring private data;
* results can be captured in CI or a local benchmark report;
* `verify` and `check_eof` timings can be compared before and after BGZF
  changes.

### M1.8 Reconcile Roadmap With Implemented Command Surface

Status: open.

Tasks:

* update roadmap wording so Milestone 1 remains substrate-focused while
  acknowledging that later-wave command slices already exist;
* identify which command behaviors are Milestone 1 evidence and which are
  downstream first slices;
* ensure `docs/roadmap/current_milestone.md`,
  `docs/roadmap/milestone-01-bgzf.md`, and this task map agree;
* keep aspirational items clearly labeled as deferred.

Acceptance criteria:

* readers can tell what is required to close Milestone 1;
* existing later-wave commands are not mistaken for proof that Milestone 1 is
  complete;
* roadmap, task map, and user-facing docs do not contradict each other.

### M1.9 Confirm Dependency Boundaries

Status: open.

Tasks:

* audit production `src/` usage of `noodles`;
* keep CRAM compatibility as the only production exception;
* add or update a dependency-boundary test or documented review checklist;
* document any temporary exception with removal criteria.

Acceptance criteria:

* production BAM/BGZF/FASTQ hot paths have no `noodles` dependency;
* CRAM compatibility remains isolated;
* future agents have a clear guardrail for dependency review.

### M1.10 Close Milestone 1

Status: blocked by M1.1 through M1.9.

Tasks:

* run all required verification commands;
* run BGZF microbenchmarks;
* update Sphinx technical docs;

* update roadmap status from active/incomplete to complete only after evidence
  is recorded;
* commit and push the closing milestone change.

Acceptance criteria:

* tests pass;
* contract checks pass;
* benchmark hooks are runnable and documented;
* documentation is current;
* Milestone 1 completion evidence is recorded in the repository.
